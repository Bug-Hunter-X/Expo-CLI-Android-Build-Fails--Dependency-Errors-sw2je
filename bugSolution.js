The solution to this issue may involve several steps:

1. **Explicitly Specifying Dependencies:** Ensure you list all your dependencies and their versions in your `app.json` or `package.json`. This provides a more controlled environment.

2. **Cleaning the Android Build System:** Before building, try deleting the `android` folder from your project and running `expo prebuild` again. This could clear out cached or corrupted files. Be careful not to delete the `android` folder if it's not fully created by expo init yet.

3. **Update Expo and Dependencies:** Make sure you have the latest versions of Expo and your project's dependencies. Updating your packages can often resolve issues caused by outdated software.

4. **Investigate Specific Error Messages:**  Pay close attention to the specific error messages returned by the build process. They often provide valuable clues as to the cause of the problem. Search for the error message on the internet or in the Expo forums.
